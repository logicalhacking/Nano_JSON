@Article{ brucker:afp-nano-json:2022,
	abstract  = {JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is common format for exchanging data, 
	             based on a collection of key/value-pairs (the JSON objects) and lists. 
			     Its syntax is inspired by JavaScript with the aim of being easy to read
				 and write for humans and easy to parse and generate for machines.

                 Despite its origin in the JavaScript world, JSON is language-independent and 
				 many programming languages support working with JSON-encoded data. This makes 
				 JSON an interesting format for exchanging data with Isabelle/HOL.

                 This AFP entry provides a JSON-like import-expert format for both Isabelle/ML 
				 and Isabelle/HOL. On the one hand, this AFP entry provides means for Isabelle/HOL 
				 users to work with JSON encoded data without the need using Isabelle/ML. On the 
				 other and, the provided Isabelle/ML interfaces allow additional extensions or 
				 integration into Isabelle extensions written in Isabelle/ML. While format is not 
				 fully JSON compliant (e.g., due to limitations in the range of supported Unicode 
				 characters), it works in most situations: the provided implementation in 
				 Isabelle/ML and its representation in Isabelle/HOL have been used successfully in 
				 several projects for exchanging data sets of several hundredths of megabyte between 
				 Isabelle and external tools.},
